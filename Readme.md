### reddit in the terminal

little project I made when learning unit testing with jest.

- zero dependency, I made an observable module for ui updates and a fetch like http.request wrapper for getting resource.

- currently gets the reddit front page posts in a 10 post/request pagination.

WIP and I plan to add more fetures like viewing comment chains and viewing images etc.
